colmgr
======

its under developement althought it seems to stabilize as less and less things need to change

So this collection manager provides the layer between client code and a collection backend.

it defines the api a backend must satisfy.

How it's used... you need a working backend

the best backend currently is see tree/treebuf/

run the tests in tree/treebuf/* test.go
